Mostly automated analysis of the 2024 manifestos
===

This archive contains materials which will allow you to create
left-right scores for the party manifestos, starting with the PDFs of
those manifestos.

In order to replicate the analysis, you will need to know how to use
both Python and R.

THe first stage is cleaning the PDFs. I've found pdfminer.six does a
good job of handling multicolumn layouts.

 - python python/con_script.py
 - python python/lab_script.py

and so on, for the remaining parties. The scripts are lightly
customised for each party to take account of differing headers and
typographical conventions.

The second stage is taking the text output and splitting it into
sentences. That's done in R, via

 - R CMD BATCH R/clean.R

After that, it's back to Python, where we make predictions using a
pre-trained model. The following command should take care of
everything, if you've got all the dependencies installed:

 - python python/manifestoberta.py
